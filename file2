hat could cause my git pre- and post- commit hooks to not run?

(please note: this question is not a duplicate; the answer to each of the other questions is either chmod +x or "don't have a file extension", and neither are the issue here)

They are executable:

$ ls -alh .git/hooks/*-commit
-rwxr-xr-x  … .git/hooks/post-commit
-rwxr-xr-x  … .git/hooks/pre-commit

And this is the content of each of them:

#!/bin/sh
echo "$0 IS RUNNING"
exit 1

Running them manually works:

$ .git/hooks/pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-commit IS RUNNING

But they aren't run by git on commit:

$ git commit -am "Test hooks"
[master d17c0f38] Test hooksfile1
file2
file3
file4
file5
